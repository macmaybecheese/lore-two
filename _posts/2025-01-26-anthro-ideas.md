# Anthros–just some ideas

## Dragons

I imagine anthropomorphic dragons to be in roughly 3 groups.

The first would be the ***Aleman Empire***

The Aleman Empire is an empire primarily consisting of anthropomorphic dragons. I’m imagining people might call that race / species ‘Dragonborn’. The current ruler is Ajahan Veterax. 

The entire royal family are innately Sources, and have purple scales. Their magic is varied, but tends to align to the kinds of breath dragons can exhale (this is called a ‘breath weapon’), such as fire, poison, ice, lightning, acid, and concussive blasts of sound. Magic that follows these basic groupings is called ‘Chromatic’ or ‘Chroma’ magic. Dragons can breathe other things, such as stunning or soporific gas, however, those tend to be secondary ‘breath weapons’. 

As for actual dragons, I’ll say they’ve got human-level intelligence (and are often much smarter than the average human), but don’t really build empires or societies. This is the common approach for D&D, which a lot of my choices are based on (since we want, at least, a somewhat generic fantasy setting). It’s also the prime furry choice, at least, to my knowledge. 

Kerian Veterax is the 3rd son of Ajahan Veterax. He is aligned most to acid. He’s totally spoiled, and a bit of a smug brat, but very relaxed and laid back. 

This was a teeny bit of D&D worldbuilding, but I’m importing it here, since it seems to fit. 

In D&D, Dragonborn don’t have wings, but a lot of furry stuff (?) has anthro dragons with wings. I’ll leave it up to you, but I’m imagining wings to be variable. In the latest version of D&D (5th edition, revised in 2024), all Dragonborn can manifest wings made out of the energy of their breath weapon for a short time. They can do this when they reach a high enough level.

Since there isn’t a level system here, and I’m not sure if you want these anthro dragons to have breath weapons, there’s a little bit of work that needs to be done.

I find it pretty funny that someone *can* play a royal character that also has the rare (special, main-character syndrome risking) trait of being a Source—but they have to play an anthro!

The second group would be in ***tribes***:

Outside of the Aleman Empire, tribal groups of Dragonborn roam, as well as lone individuals. This is partly because I have a thing for buff, wild dragon dudes and gals, but I think it might be useful to add. 

We haven’t gone over the scale of the roleplay setting (how big it is, how vast it is, how much of the world is going to be used in the actual roleplay). I have a feeling we might end up having a smaller scale in roleplay compared to the actual scale of the world that we’ve developed. If you want to lean into the cryptid angle / the Ones, sticking to one terrain type (dense forest) would be useful. If it’s just one terrain type that’s used, a smaller setting in which the roleplay occurs would make that more possible.

As such, this would make Dragonborn more of a ‘thing’ (more present) in this setting, since they’re less tied to a possibly distant empire.

The third group would be a ***diaspora***:

This just means any Dragonborn who aren’t subjects / citizens of the Aleman Empire. Simple as.

## Wolves and Canines

I’m imagining them to mostly reside among humans, with the occasional tribe here and there. 

Of course, while there’d be a lot of inter-mingling, there would probably be an ethnic enclave—like a Chinatown, almost. Perhaps a feudal manor or barony is held by a wolf, and populated mostly by anthro wolves. 

## Foxes

I have no fucking clue about foxes. Perhaps they could be wandering scoundrels and troubadours. Maybe they’d be like how wolves and canines are described, but with elves? Maybe they’d also live among humans? Both?

Perhaps I could take a leaf out of a furry tabletop RPG and make gray foxes blue-blooded (figuratively) aristocrats?

## Bats

Bats are often associated with vampirism. I’m imagining at least a few being rich nobles. Old money, castles, and manors. Another kind could be travelling people, so on. 

If vampires exist, then anthropomorphic bats could take on some vampiric traits, even if they aren’t vampires—regeneration, being able to eat blood, gaining a Quantum on blood consumption, wholly or partially transforming into mist, not appearing or partially appearing in silver-backed mirrors or silver based photography (Daguerreotype, etc.), having some innate charming magical ability, so on. These traits, of course, would be random. 

## The Predator–Prey Problem, or, how I learned to stop worrying and love names

Now, so far, I’ve only described anthros of carnivorous or omnivorous species. What about prey animals?

I could make them—maybe there’d just be little to no tension, since they aren’t wild animals at all. Even then, white-tailed deer are opportunistic carnivores. 

There’s also the deal with anthro and non-anthro versions of animals. I’d just ignore it, mostly, maybe give anthro species specific names, so on. 

## Other Anthro Species?
I want some sort of bird. Maybe a couple of sorts. 

I also want another scalie option outside of Dragonborn—snakes?

I haven’t developed anything with cats. I don’t really like anthro house cats all that much, and cat species, in general, are a classification nightmare, even in real life. Mmbut there might be at least one person that wants one. 

For now, all other anthros are either integrated in one other nation—especially human nations—or are tribes / travelling/wandering people.
