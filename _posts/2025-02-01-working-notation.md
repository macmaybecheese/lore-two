This document assumes a living Shaper with standard human-like physiology. 

Revisiting previous documentation on the mechanics of magical workings, Living Shapers need to fulfill the metaphysical, ritual, and material components of a working in order for it to happen.

A working's tags are for ease of searching for workings with specific characteristics.

A working's **Quanta Cost** indicates how much Quanta to be expended for the working to be set in motion. 

“Ø” indicates a lack of a need for the indicated value. A working with a Quanta Cost of Ø is a Nil Quanta Working. Ø can be pronounced as “nil”.

Recall that, 

**Metaphysical Components**: Connection with a Source, the Source’s power, one’s skill with magic, the ability and resilience to shape the amount of power they access, etc.   
**Ritual Components:** Whatever the shaper needs to actually *do* to perform the working. Crushing a black pearl, speaking backwards from a profane codex, outstretching one’s hand, viewing the target, and so on.  
**Material Components:** Whatever physical things are needed for a working. Some living Sources want offerings, and some spells require a piece of their target.

In a working’s description, they are abbreviated as:  
**M**:   
**R**:   
**M**:  

“Standard” indicates everything able to be implied, in terms of Metaphysical Components. It doesn’t need to be spelled out that you need to be able to Shape, have the prerequisite Quanta, or that you need the ability to move your hands if the Ritual Components need you to do that. Goetic spells need to be written in a Grimoire, unless they’re able to be cast innately (the latter is mostly reserved for the supernatural creatures). Acquiring Quanta can be different for different Shapers, so it's pointless to write every possibility, when "Standard" works.

Generally, most workings will have “Standard” Metaphysical Components.

Material Components are not consumed unless noted. Material Components that are consumed and/or have a specified cost *must* be supplied. Otherwise, a Focus may replace Material Components. 

A Focus is anything that aids in Shaping. It is most likely an item that serves as a secondary shaper—wands, staves, rods, orbs, crystals, etc. Depending on its description, it may confer additional benefits.

A working’s **Shaping Time** indicates how much time is required to perform the Ritual Components before the magic takes effect.

1 Action indicates that this can be done in about 6 seconds. You can think about that in other ways too, like how long it’d take for a knight to swing their sword, or a dragon to breathe a deadly cone of flame. It’s a short beat, but it’s not instant.

A Shaping Time of "Reaction" indicates that the working can be Shaped in an instant. It would be a reaction to something, like casting Absorb Chroma right before being engulfed in a blast of flame.

Workings cannot be Shaped concurrently—at the same time. At least, not by human-like minds & bodies. 

A working’s **Duration** indicates how long it lasts before its magic fades away. 

**Concentration** indicates that the working needs to be actively concentrated upon throughout its duration. If this concentration is lost, the working ends prematurely. It is incredibly difficult—and thus downright impossible for the mortal humanoid Shapers this document assumes—to concentrate on multiple workings at once.

If there is something that causes the working’s Shaper to lose their focus, such as being injured heavily enough, or the Shaper deciding to end their concentration, the working stops, even if its duration is longer.

A working with a duration of “Instantaneous” means that the magic that fuels it is gone in a flash, leaving only a non-magical or mildly-magical result. If an Instantaneous working burns someone’s arm off, Dispel Magic or similar magics would do nothing.

A working with a duration of “Until Dispelled” indicates that the magical effect it causes is permanent. However, this effect is sustained by magic, so something that removes or purges magic from it would be able to end this working.

A working’s **Range** is self explanatory. Outside that range, the magic of the working frays and cannot manifest to any practical effect. An exception is when a working creates a point within that range, and the magic takes effect within some volume around that point—if that point is created at the edge of a range, the effect may extend beyond the range.

A spell with a range of Self can only target its Shaper.

The concept of "turns" are used in the descriptions of workings. While there is no turn system, it is easily visualized. 

SI units (and SI derived units) are used where applicable. 

Here's an example of what a spell would look like:

# Absorb Chroma

Tags: 1Q, Chroma, Protection, Spell

**Quanta Cost**: 1 Quantum  
**M**: Standard, 1 Q  
**R**: Cupping hands to chest or pointing Focus to chest.  
**M**: Ø  
**Shaping Time:** Reaction  
**Duration:** Until the end of the Shaper’s next turn  
**Range:** Self

The Shaper of this spell receives only half of the damage they would receive from a source of Chromatic damage. 

Upon being hit with either fire, poison, ice (or other source of freezing cold), lightning, acid, or concussive blasts of sound, the Shaper can only receive half of the damage of the type they received first after casting this spell. 

For example: A Shaper who casts Absorb Chroma after being hit with a torch would only halve incoming damage from fire until the spell ends.

The Shaper of this spell is charged with Chroma of the type absorbed. While this spell is active, their melee attacks deal additional damage of the type they absorbed.

*Cool, huh?* Generally, the first line of text describing a working's effects has little no bearing on the working's effect—it just summarizes the working and/or gives it some backstory (or vibes). Take this other spell—

# Fae Fire

Tags: 1Q, Chroma, Debuff, Goetia, Spell

**Quanta Cost**: 1 Quantum  
**M**: Standard, 1 Q  
**R**: A snickering incantation in the ancient Fae tongue.  
**M**: Ø  
**Shaping Time:** 1 Action  
**Duration:** 1 minute, Concentration  
**Range:** 18 m

An ancient spell, on the lips of beings far before the empires of mankind.

Within a 6 m<sup>3</sup> cube in range, everything becomes outlined in multicolor flames—often blue, green, and violet. These flames are only slightly warm and do no damage. 

These flames emit dim, but illuminating, light for 3 m. Anything outlined in flame cannot benefit from invisibility, and are easier to attack if its attacker can see them. 

## Extensions

An extension is an additional effect, or a modification to the rules of a specific Ability or Abilities. 

Generally, a Shaper may have a number of extension equal to their Quanta Pool, or half of their Quanta Pool.

A Shaper does **not** have any of the extension under an Ability by default. They must choose them. 

**Augment (X Q):** Indicates that portion of the extension adds to the Quanta Cost of the Ability if it's chosen. You can choose to not use an augment. The augment must be chosen when the ability is Shaped, unless it states otherwise.

**Drawbacks** are a special kind of extension. They impose some sort of limitation, and often give an extra extension for that Ability.

These are a major difference between Abilities and Spells. Let's look at a sample Ability!

# Creation

Tags: Theurgia, Ability, NQW

**Quanta Cost**: Ø  
**M**: Standard  
**R**: Ø  
**M**: Ø  
**Shaping Time:** 1 Action  
**Duration:** 1 minute, Concentration  
**Range:** Special

Tapping into the powers of creation beheld to the divine, you can create objects out of magic. 

The basic use of this ability is to create a solid object made out of vegetable matter in your hands. Vegetable matter means materials made from or of plants—wood, industrial hemp, vegetable wax, cotton, paper, and so on. 

This object cannot have a volume greater than .8 m<sup>3</sup> (Tiny). 

When your Quanta Pool is 5, that increases to 1.5 m<sup>3</sup> (Small); at 11, 3 m<sup>3</sup> (Medium); at 17, 4.5 m<sup>3</sup> (Large). 

If you cannot hold it, it appears in a nearby, unoccupied space no farther than 9 m away from you. 

You cannot create objects that have special properties (rare herbs needed for a powerful working or prophecy), nor can you create objects that you have no knowledge of (the key to a lock you didn’t make). You cannot create objects that require alchemy (chemical synthesis), brewing, or similar procedures. 

Creating simple objects, like chairs, candles or clubs is easy. However, creating complex objects, like objects with moving parts, is a test of spatial reasoning and mechanical knowledge. There is uncertainty as if you were crafting that object. If you fail, it comes into existence non-functional.

While these objects are not magical, they possess a quantic fingerprint, and thus can be detected as being the result of magic. Vendors will likely check for magically created materials if they are valuable enough, and reject them.

**Augment (1 Q):** You can create an object two volumes larger than you already can. If you already can create Large objects, your maximum volume is 8 m<sup>3</sup>. 

**Augment (2 Q):** You no longer require concentration. You can choose this augment even after this ability has been Shaped.

### Creation Extensions

## Additional Materials

**Augment (1 Q):** You are able to create objects out of any solid material that is not harmful, doesn’t have any special properties, and is not especially durable and/or valuable. For example, glass, bone, or ice. You are also able to create harmless liquids, like water, dye, or ink. However, you cannot create gasses, and you cannot create (unprocessed) flesh—tallow, vellum and leather are fine. 

As your Quanta Pool grows, you get access to more resilient and rare materials. 

| Quanta Pool Size | Materials |
| :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Stone |
| 5 | Common metals (iron, steel, copper); Harmless gasses (air, nitrogen, helium) |
| 11 | Precious metals (gold, silver); Semi-precious materials (jet, fur, amber, horn, crystal) |
| 17 | Gems |

## (Al)chemical Synthesis

**Augment (1 Q):** You can create an object that requires alchemy (chemical synthesis), such as basic poisons, acid, antitoxin, alcohol, gunpowder, and so on, as allowed by the setting. You cannot create magical objects with this extension, such as potions. You can create liquids with this extension, but only as needed to create alchemical items—not water or olive oil, for example. If you are able to make gasses with Creation via the Additional Materials extension, you may make gasses that would require alchemy (chemistry) and are harmful. 

## Fine Detail

You are able to make intricate and complex objects with less effort and uncertainty. Even if you do not know how to craft particular objects (woodworking, smithing, etc.) you are considered as being able to. If you already are, you are twice as proficient at creating them with magic.

## Food and Drink

**Augment (1 Q):** You can create enough food and drink to sustain a number of human-sized creatures equal to your Quanta Cap for a day. Doing so takes 10 minutes to shape, instead of an Action. The duration of Creation for this instance is considered to be Instantaneous. Therefore, the food is non-magical and permanently created.

The food created by this use of Creation is bland, but nourishing. If you also possess the Fine Detail extension, you can create food of any quality, but are subject to the rules of creating complex objects.

**Augment (1 Q):** This use of Creation has a Shaping Time of 1 Action.

## Multitudes

You are able to make multiple objects, so long as they are of materials you can create, and they fit within your maximum volume. These objects do not need to be the same. An example of this would be a quiver and arrows or a row of candles. 

## Restraining Creations

**Augment (1 Q):** You may create a non-harmful object directly on a being, but they may be able to dodge it. These could be manacles, rope, or something else that restrains but does not deal direct damage. 

### Drawbacks

## Limited to One

You can only create objects with a single fragile solid material as described in the Expanded Materials extension. You cannot take the Expanded Materials extension. 

You gain an additional extension for Creation.
