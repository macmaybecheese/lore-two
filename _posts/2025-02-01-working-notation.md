This document assumes a living Shaper with standard human-like physiology. 

Revisiting previous documentation on the mechanics of magical workings, Living Shapers need to fulfill the metaphysical, ritual, and material components of a working in order for it to happen.

A working's **Quanta Cost** indicates how much Quanta to be expended for the working to be set in motion. 

“Ø” indicates a lack of a need for the indicated value. A working with a Quanta Cost of Ø is a Nil Quanta Working. Ø can be pronounced as “nil”.

Recall that, 

**Metaphysical Components**: Connection with a Source, the Source’s power, one’s skill with magic, the ability and resilience to shape the amount of power they access, etc.   
**Ritual Components:** Whatever the shaper needs to actually *do* to perform the working. Crushing a black pearl, speaking backwards from a profane codex, outstretching one’s hand, viewing the target, and so on.  
**Material Components:** Whatever physical things are needed for a working. Some living Sources want offerings, and some spells require a piece of their target.

In a working’s description, they are abbreviated as:  
**M**:   
**R**:   
**M**:  

“Standard” indicates everything able to be implied, in terms of Metaphysical Components. It doesn’t need to be spelled out that you need to be able to Shape, have the prerequisite Quanta, or that you need the ability to move your hands if the Ritual Components need you to do that. Goetic spells need to be written in a Grimoire, unless they’re able to be cast innately (the latter is mostly reserved for the supernatural creatures). 

Generally, most workings will have “Standard” Metaphysical Components.

Material Components are not consumed unless noted. Material Components that are consumed and/or have a specified cost *must* be supplied. Otherwise, a Focus may replace Material Components. 

A Focus is anything that aids in Shaping. It is most likely an item that serves as a secondary shaper—wands, staves, rods, orbs, crystals, etc. Depending on its description, it may confer additional benefits.

A working’s **Shaping Time** indicates how much time is required to perform the Ritual Components before the magic takes effect.

1 Action indicates that this can be done in about 6 seconds. You can think about that in other ways too, like how long it’d take for a knight to swing their sword, or a dragon to breathe a deadly cone of flame. It’s a short beat, but it’s not instant.

A Shaping Time of "Reaction" indicates that the working can be Shaped in an instant. It would be a reaction to something, like casting Absorb Chroma right before being engulfed in a blast of flame.

Workings cannot be Shaped concurrently—at the same time. At least, not by human-like minds & bodies. 

A working’s **Duration** indicates how long it lasts before its magic fades away. 

**Concentration** indicates that the working needs to be actively concentrated upon throughout its duration. If this concentration is lost, the working ends prematurely. It is incredibly difficult—and thus downright impossible for the mortal humanoid Shapers this document assumes—to concentrate on multiple workings at once.

If there is something that causes the working’s Shaper to lose their focus, such as being injured heavily enough, or the Shaper deciding to end their concentration, the working stops, even if its duration is longer.

A working with a duration of “Instantaneous” means that the magic that fuels it is gone in a flash, leaving only a non-magical or mildly-magical result. If an Instantaneous working burns someone’s arm off, Dispel Magic or similar magics would do nothing.

A working with a duration of “Until Dispelled” indicates that the magical effect it causes is permanent. However, this effect is sustained by magic, so something that removes or purges magic from it would be able to end this working.

A working’s **Range** is self explanatory. Outside that range, the magic of the working frays and cannot manifest to any practical effect. An exception is when a working creates a point within that range, and the magic takes effect within some volume around that point—if that point is created at the edge of a range, the effect may extend beyond the range.

A spell with a range of Self can only target its Shaper.

The concept of "turns" are used in the descriptions of workings. While there is no turn system, it is easily visualized. 

SI units (and SI derived units) are used where applicable.
