# Cryslock Items

Cryslock technology is very simple, and considered to be outdated in more developed and ‘civilized’ areas. However, its simplicity grants it wider accessibility.

It is conceptually very similar to flintlock mechanisms and the far earlier matchlock mechanisms. An artificial Source (typically a crystal, hence the name ’cryslock’) is mechanically linked to a trigger. When the trigger is pulled, the Source makes contact with magical circuitry (runes, diagrams, channels, what have you) inside the barrel that can (in only one way) shape Quanta. This causes a working to occur. When the trigger is no longer depressed, the Source is pulled away.

The Source, being tiny, can only create Nil Quanta Workings that do not need any input other than power—unchanging, reproducible magic effects. The user of a cryslock doesn’t Shape the working, and they cannot exert control over it—they can only aim the cryslock. Cryslocks usually can only have one kind of NQW inscribed in the barrel—any way to switch workings would involve rotating the barrel to have the Source touch another side.

Full cryslock long-guns have space for more complex workings, while pistols do not. 

Because of their general imprecision and crudeness, they’re mostly weapons. Telekinesis, for example, could not work, because the cryslock has no way of determining a target. There is no Shaper beyond the singular path of the circuit. However, creating a dart of magical force that travels in a straight line, a linear ray of lightning, or a cone in which non-magical fire gets extinguished would work.

A skilled enough Shaper could channel Quanta into the circuit, and Shape the *result*, but using an actual Focus is much more efficient. It’s rumored that insurgents have capitalized on this effect, making cryslock weapons blow up in their wielders' faces.

Despite this, they still don’t require ammunition aside from occasionally replaced Sources, a  
are still effective tools and weapons.

# Wand-core Items

Wand-core technology is a few steps above cryslock technology. While wands or other Foci (plural of Focus) that store ‘charges’ of workings often need to be attuned (connected with to be used) to a Shaper, wand-core items do not.

They’re commonly found with either bolt action or break action mechanisms. For double-barreled or multi-chambered (revolver) wand-cored items, break action is common.  This allows the core to be swapped, and for magical effects to be loaded. However, many wand-cores are designed around a specific effect.

The core is a specialized cylindrical ‘wand’, often made of metal. While able to be used by living Shapers, they’re a bit shorter than most care to use. They’re designed to be loaded into wand-cores. While each core can act as a Source, removable artificial Sources can be attached to a wand-core to fuel more expensive workings.   
   
Barrels aren’t necessary, however, they’re often patterned with conductive channels that accelerate the magical effect, and/or create more distance between the ‘wand’, the operator, and the working (often giving just a little more range). 

Wand-cores are made in such a way that the working that the core Shapes can be affected by an operator. So, while they’re spectacular weapons, they can be utilized for other purposes. While living Shapers are still superior and more versatile, wand-cores can work magic in the pull of a trigger, without the exertion or concentration of a living Shaper.

They’re rare to find outside of cities.
