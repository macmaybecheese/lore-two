Known also to the people of Þiuthangardi (𐌸𐌹𐌿𐌳𐌳𐌰𐌽𐌲𐌰𐍂𐌳𐌹) as Wilþyans (𐍅𐌹𐌻𐌸𐌾𐌰𐌽𐍃), the Aldwylds are the principal setting. 

It is an insular peninsula (or island, I'll decide later) covered in dense forest, both pine and broadleaf. It is a somewhat dark land, ruled less by kingdoms and empires, but by bands of people and regional leaders. But, first, let’s look at those outside rulers.

## The Kingdoms and Empires Known to This World

### Þiuthangardi (𐌸𐌹𐌿𐌳𐌳𐌰𐌽𐌲𐌰𐍂𐌳𐌹

Þiuthangardi (𐌸𐌹𐌿𐌳𐌳𐌰𐌽𐌲𐌰𐍂𐌳𐌹) is a wide reaching kingdom, primarily composed of humans, but people of every kind have been known to live within it.

Note, the language I used to make names for things pertaining to Þiuthangardi is the Gothic language. I use both the Gothic alphabet and the romanization of Gothic to write these words. However, there are some modifications:

- To represent a voiced dental fricative (the ‘th’ in ‘father’, but not the ‘th’ of ‘thigh’ or ‘path’), I represent it in the Gothic alphabet with 𐌳𐌳, rather than 𐌳, to distinguish it from the voiced alveolar plosive (d).   
- A voiced dental fricative is written as ‘th’ rather than as ‘d’.   
- While there are ‘environment-of-occurrence' and other rules to help distinguish this kinda stuff, I feel this is easier.  
- Note that the letter thorn (Þ and þ) is the ‘th’ in ‘thigh’ and ‘path’ (unvoiced dental fricative)

I'm probably not going to change Gothic romanization and orthography too much, because I feel that's too much work that doesn't benefit enough people.

### The Aleman Empire

The Aleman Empire is an empire primarily consisting of the dragonborn (anthropomorphic dragons).

The current ruler is Emperor Ajahan Veterax. The whole royal family are innately Sources. Each member's magic tends to align along one facet of Chromatic magic. For instance, Kerian Veterax, the 3rd son of Ajahan Veterax, is aligned most to acid.

## Regions of the Aldwylds

### Fathomsdeep

Fathomsdeep is the eastern region of the Aldwylds. The land considered part of Fathomsdeep are beaches and coves. However, Fathomsdeep also extends into the sea, especially for aquatic species and those with access to the latest diving technology.

It is possibly the wealthiest region, being a port. Additionally, due to the sea, Quanta-holding crystals can be mined, and sea salt can be taken from the water.

Steam and magic-powered equipment is more likely to be found in Fathomsdeep.

The leader of this region does not have any traits specified for them yet.

### Þeihwobaurgs (𐌸𐌴𐌹𐍈𐍉𐌱𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌲𐍃) / Giubiare 

Þeihwobaurgs is also known as Giubiare to the populace, especially to those who aren’t accustomed to the old Þiuthangardyōs (“of Þiuthangardi”) language used as its name.

It is a well settled city, although one might compare it to a town in size. It’s quite the popular spot for pilgrims from the mainland. It's populated with merchants and tradesmen. 

It is a bit of an enclave for Þiuthangardyōs wolffolk (anthropomorphic wolves).

Atop a hill (mountain?) to its northeast is a castle where the region’s leader, a baron(ess), lives. They have prisine fur of a single color (white, black). Those are their specified traits.

### The Ruins

The Aldwylds are full of ruins. However, I'm talking about a valley to the west of Giubiare. While beautiful, very few live in it—discounting pilgrims. The Ruins are a quiet place, with just the winds and birds, but where in the Aldwylds isn’t?

The Briar is known to infest this place. Supernaturally fast growing thorny vines, the Briar consumes entire buildings. Some ascribe alien intelligence to it, and draw magic from it. 

There is a place where outcasts are healed here. Many opt to stay on its grounds.

On the mountain in the north of this region are the Hermit’s Woods, called such for the many caves that can be found there.

The leader of this region has bandaged hands, feet and eyes. They wear woolen clothing. They speak in many voices.
