# how the magic system actually works

## BIG WARNING HOLD ONTO YOUR TITS

Magic is meant to have a sense of wonder and mystery to it, as mentioned in the earlier documentation that you've (hopefully) read. 

You should keep in mind that characters might not know all of this below. People who work magic might not know how it works. 

## Sources and Shapers

There’s two basic parts of any magical working, the Shaper and the Source. Here, a magical working is any sort of magic that happens. It could be a spell that’s been cast, an item being infused with magic, a minor expression of magical ability, so on.

The Source is anything that provides the raw magical ‘power’ (both in the physics definition of the rate of energy change / transfer, and in the common definition of energy and might). 

The Shaper is whatever takes the power and turns it into a working—a change upon the world. 

For example, a wand with a magic crystal in it would be both a Shaper and Source if the wand, in some way, aided another Shaper, or if it produced a magical working upon being activated in some way.

Thus, a Shaper could either be an inanimate object, or a living being. 

## Components 

Living Shapers need to fulfill the metaphysical, ritual, and material components of a working in order for it to happen.

**Metaphysical Components**: Connection with a Source, the Source’s power, one’s skill with magic, the ability and resilience to shape the amount of power they access, etc. 

**Ritual Components**: Whatever the shaper needs to actually do to perform the working. Crushing a black pearl, speaking backwards from a profane codex, outstretching one’s hand, viewing the target, and so on.

**Material Components**: Whatever physical things are needed for a working. Some living Sources want offerings, and some spells require a piece of their target.

### Examples of Sources

- Living Sources
    - The Ones Who Lurk are a prime example of this. They are potent magic-users themselves, but often make deals with people, or gift people, and become a Source. (The Ones can be considered people, but here, ‘people’ means people excluding the Ones.)
    - One might argue nature is one, but that’s going to be its own category.
    - Some people just are Sources. This is rare. 
    - Innately magical beings naturally fulfill the metaphysical, ritual, and material components to their existence, and, thus, are Sources.
- Nature
   - Pretty self explanatory. The magic power accessible from nature is proportional to the individual Shaper’s connection to nature, and the density of nature around them.
   - But as nature lets itself be changed, so too does it change its Shaper.
- Artificial Sources
   - While they are often thought of as a modern invention, they’ve been around for a long time. 
   - A witch might condense magic power into an object, so they might be able to use that power later, or in a place where nature is less present.
   - However, newer techniques allow magic power to be crystalized, or otherwise stored.
   - Unless some kind of reaction causes this power to be generated, these Sources are temporary

## Quanta

A Quantum (plural: ‘quanta’) is the base unit of power gathered from a Source. 

Quanta are discrete (in the form of integers), in that they are a self-contained package, a quantity.

1 Quantum is always 1 Quantum, and there is no such thing as ½ Quanta. 

Any excess not used by the working is harmlessly dissipated, such as in bright light, glowing runes; any power needed that would not cost another Quantum is gathered from the environment—a drop in a room’s temperature, a mage’s bodily energy (calories) being used, and so on.
