title: The Civilized (and not quite civilized) Species of The Aldwylds

Generally, I'm allowing most species (or race, whatever) in this roleplay setting. 

However, there just isn't any existing lore for the 'common' fantasy species—orcs, elves, dwarves, and so on.

I only have ideas for humans and various anthropomorphic animals. For now, I recommend playing either, just so there aren't any continuity issues.

Take these assorted musings.

## Dragons

I imagine anthropomorphic dragons to be in roughly 3 groups.

Having wings is a variable trait, and some that don't have wings might be able to manifest spectral wings of the same Chroma type as their breath weapon. Which could also be variable? Dragonborn are a varied bunch.

As for actual dragons, I’ll say they’ve got human-level intelligence (and are often much smarter than the average human), but don’t really build empires or societies.

The first would be the ***Aleman Empire***

The Aleman Empire is an empire primarily consisting of anthropomorphic dragons. I’m imagining people might call that race / species ‘Dragonborn’. The current ruler is Ajahan Veterax. 

Kerian Veterax is the 3rd son of Ajahan Veterax. He is aligned most to acid. He’s totally spoiled, and a bit of a smug brat, but very relaxed and laid back. 

The second group would be in ***tribes***:

Outside of the Aleman Empire, tribal groups of Dragonborn roam, as well as lone individuals.

The third group would be a ***diaspora***:

This just means any Dragonborn who aren’t subjects / citizens of the Aleman Empire. Simple as.


## Wolves and Canines

I’m imagining them to mostly reside among humans, with the occasional tribe here and there. 

Of course, there's the 'ethnic' enclave of Giubare, which has a higher population of them.

'Anthro' sounds too technical. Let's call them wolffolk.

## Foxes

I have no fucking clue about foxes. Perhaps they could be wandering scoundrels and troubadours? Maybe they’d be like how wolves and canines are described, but with elves? Maybe they’d also live among humans? Both?

Fuck, man, this is too detailed already. 

## Bats

Bats are often associated with vampirism. I’m imagining at least a few being rich nobles. Old money, castles, and manors. Another kind could be travelling people, so on. 

If vampires exist, then anthropomorphic bats could take on some vampiric traits, even if they aren’t vampires—regeneration, being able to eat blood, gaining a Quantum on blood consumption, wholly or partially transforming into mist, not appearing or partially appearing in silver-backed mirrors or silver based photography (Daguerreotype, etc.), having some innate charming magical ability, so on. These traits, of course, would be random. 

## Other Anthro Species?

As long as it's got a human body plan, it should be fine.

Ravens and/or crows are quite setting-appropriate! Other birds would be, too.

As for insects, I will probably play an anthropomorphic spider (human body plan; 2 legs) at some point, so don't be afraid to play one, either. Moths are also neat.

Fathomsdeep is practically begging to be filled with interesting aquatic species. Play a buff octopus dude, a sly shark pirate, or a cowardly squid cult leader!
