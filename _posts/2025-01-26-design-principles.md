## Magic is supposed to be mysterious and wondrous—but there are rules behind the scenes.

Having magic be entirely obscure can work when there’s only one writer in a story. However, I’m not you, and you aren’t me, so if there’s no way to communicate how magic works—it’ll fall apart. 

## Numbers are supposed to guide the imagination, not restrict it. 

I hope this is self-explanatory enough. Video games and tabletop roleplaying games give you them, because it lays everything out before you. You have a better concept—a better internal visualization—of your resources and your power when you put numbers and names to them.

## However, they are also for balance.

Being powerful is fun. I *love* playing powerful characters. But, working within limits can be fun. Also, before breaking the rules, you’ve got to stay within them.

## I’m not going to go overboard with numbers.

I don’t plan to add in HP, XP, or character levels unless there’s a demand for it. For now—**if you’re a mage**—consider your Quanta Pool your level, if you really need that for your way of visualization.
 
## This should be built in a way that you can skip over *some* parts.

There’s going to be 5 kingdoms / empires, along with tribes, and several races / species.  I plan to make magic terminology, and the way magic gets classified, different for each one. 

That’s a lot. However, this is where the first principle comes in—*you don’t need to know all of that!*

Once everything here is fleshed out, you just need to read the core mechanics and premise. After that, you can skip to your race (species) and kingdom (or other group). 

Of course, you could skim over everything and pick one after that. I recommend doing something like that. You could just go in blind—”I’m going to be a buff wolf man, *dammit*, and I’ll learn whatever lore they’ve got!”

Now, if you want to play a wise and/or a smart character, it’d help to dive in more. 

## Magic is extensible.

What this means is that, while magic is pretty set in stone, you can reshape or modify the way it gets expressed.

Now, this is all pretty far into the ‘plans’ part. 

I plan to let workings fall into 2 categories:

**Spells**: These work pretty similar to spells in most games. You put Quanta in, and get a magic effect out. However, I plan to have other spells, magic abilities, and features modify certain parts of a spell being cast—at a cost. Spells might have some scaling, but it'll be nothing like...

**Abilities**: Where it really gets extensible. Abilities often start out as Nil Quanta Workings, but you can *augment* them by spending more Quanta and/or choosing certain traits under that ability. 

## Flavor is free.

No, I don’t mean literally. Well, kinda.

I mean cosmetic effects, or anything that doesn’t have any impact on the mechanics of the roleplay—those are free. If you want your Fireballs to be shaped like blossoming roses, go for it!

This is why I added Tricks.
