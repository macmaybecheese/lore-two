Magic is the means to influence nature and do things beyond its grasp. Magic can, indeed, have many sources, but it must have a source. Few humans can truly say that they are a source. Most fuel their magic from nature and other beings. Without a source, no magic can occur. Likewise, where there is more nature, more sources, there is more magic.

By letting nature into oneself, one can let themselves into nature. The Ones Who Lurk have many names, and many forms, like those whose heads are the skulls of deer (and their bodies aren’t too human either), and many desires. They, too, can be the source of magic, like nature. Though, they are more prone to deals.) (One wonders if there’s any difference between the two.)

In either case, by letting in magic from a source, one undergoes changes. Light, simple magic has little effect. But, the more magic one uses, and the more impressive the changes one makes, the more one changes. Until One Lurks.

In a similar vein, magic-users are called to the Wild Hunt. Again, a mother who flavors her stew and picks things up with her mind will feel naught but a light nudge. But if one is growing antlers, animal legs, a tail—one will feel the call harder. And harder. Was their skull always that prominent since that last spell?

The Wild Hunt isn’t clearly defined, but it is known to include the Ones Who Lurk, magic-users (beyond simple practitioners), along with the weary, the weak-willed, the wild, and whoever else the Hunters tempt (or kidnap) into joining. Generally, it’s best to stay indoors, minimize magic use, along with keeping your animals and larder secure. Who knows, your son may get swept up in magic and revelry and the wild and the hunt and the Ones and never be the same.
