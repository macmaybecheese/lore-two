## Preface

Due to the currently unfinished nature of the world, this is subject to change. The first group of classifications should *not* be assumed to be universal. This is one of many.

## The Sevenfold Paths

**CHROMA**: Chromatic magic is grouped along the breaths of dragons. Fire, poison, ice, lightning, acid, and concussive blasts of sound.

**GOETIA**: Goetic magic utilizes, and is transmitted through items known as Grimoires. ‘Low magic’, includes many things.

**THEURGIA**: Some consider theurgic magic a counterpart to Goetia. Involves the divine. Taxing, difficult, and dangerous. 

**BIOTA**: Biotic magic shapes or otherwise influences living organisms and their makeup.

**ESOTERICA**: Esoteric magic is outside of these categories, and/or unique to a specific Shaper or group of Shapers.

**NOETIA**: While it influences minds, noetic magic also empowers them and expresses the power of a Shaper’s intellect.

**QUANTA**: The direct manipulation of Quanta, and the alteration of workings, is quantic magic.

### Chroma

Dragons can exhale many dangerous things. This ability is called their ‘breath weapon’. Most anthropomorphic dragons possess them as well. As stated earlier, these breath weapons can consist of fire, poison, ice, lightning, acid, and concussive blasts of sound (called thunder). 

Dragons can exhale other things, such as stunning or soporific gas, but those are always secondary to their primary breath weapon.

Magic has been found to align to these types of damage—destructive bombardments of explosive flame, arcing lightning, and roiling toxic gas\! 

However, chromatic magic *interacts* with these damage types. A spell that changes the color and brightness of a fire is just as much under the banner of Chroma as a spell that shoots forth immolating lances of flame.

### Goetia

Goetic magic is the magic of Grimoires. Its name is from an ancient word for diviners, magicians, healers, magicians, and seers. 

It’s a broad category, but under its wing is divination, contacting and summoning magical beings, crafting magical items, and, generally, spells with complex Ritual Components.

Divination, as a classification, originally meant learning about the future, exclusively. Now, it’s also come to mean any sort of knowledge-gathering through magic.

### Theurgia

Theurgia is a taxing, difficult, and dangerous path of magic to pursue. It involves contact with, invocation of, or evocation of the divine.

This is especially in an attempt to achieve oneness with it. 

Shapers must have proper Components to withstand contact with the divine. Even still, theurgic magic is risky. 

### Biota

Biota is the practice of magic which deals with life and living organisms. It can gently maintain homeostatic balance, cause rapid plant growth, create potent contagions, and reshape bodies—among numerous other things.

### A short detour to talk about limitations 

A good distinction to keep in mind is that while both Biota and Theurgia could heal a wound / sickness, the difficulty in both is unique to each type.

Theurgia’s challenge would be in harnessing divine healing power (either by siphoning/stealing/taking it, or getting it as a gift), or calling down a healing miracle. There’s also the inherent challenge and risk of *just using Theurgia in general.*

Biota’s challenge would be more in using it precisely—not making cells reproduce too quickly or too much when regrowing a wound. Healing yourself, only to get cancer, would suck\! There would be the complexities of limb regrowth, and the balancing act of trying to not upset homeostasis or set off a cytokine storm when healing a disease. 

Of course, that probably won’t factor much in the ‘meta’ aspect of roleplay. I don’t plan to add ability checks to this, unless people want that. I plan to eventually add in a mechanic to theurgic workings to represent its risk.

It’s this matter of *choice* and *application* that I think will make this magic system interesting. Shapers are *limited*, both what they can know, and what they’re able to do. It’s often said that the limitation of a magic system—what it can’t do—is  more interesting than what it *can* do.

### Esoterica

Often specialized magic that is unique to a specific Shaper or group of Shapers. This is, most likely, the result of a novel development—originally made spells. 

This is also the class for magic that does not fit within the rest of the Sevenfold.

### An even shorter detour

I’d like to say that people should avoid falling into the trap of having ‘unique’ magic. That can lead to a lack of challenge, main-character syndrome, and a lack of creativity. Esoterica, as a category, is mainly for custom made spells, magic made for specific story purposes—magic that doesn’t fit in other categories. 

### Noetia

Noetic magic can influence minds. This can be from something as insidious as mind control (which is also a pacifistic option—magic is truly outside conceptions of evil, isn’t it?), or as benevolent as pain relief.

Just as Noetia can shape minds, it can grant the mind the power to shape. Moving objects or flowing matter with one’s mind, and so forth—that is the domain of Noetia.

### Quanta

Magic can also affect magic. Magic can affect even Quanta itself. 

As outlandish as quantic magic may seem, your counterspells, so familiar, lie here.

This is where workings can change workings, like doubling an otherwise set-in-stone spell’s duration.
