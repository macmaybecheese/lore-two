## The Aldwylds

Known also to the people of Þiuthangardi (𐌸𐌹𐌿𐌳𐌳𐌰𐌽𐌲𐌰𐍂𐌳𐌹) as Wilþyans (𐍅𐌹𐌻𐌸𐌾𐌰𐌽𐍃), the Aldwylds are the principal setting. 

It is an insular peninsula (or island, I'll decide later) covered in dense forest, both pine and broadleaf. It is a somewhat dark land, ruled less by kingdoms and empires, but by bands of people and regional leaders. But, first, let’s look at those outside rulers.

## The Kingdoms and Empires Known to This World

Þiuthangardi (𐌸𐌹𐌿𐌳𐌳𐌰𐌽𐌲𐌰𐍂𐌳𐌹) is a wide reaching kingdom, primarily composed of humans, but people of every kind have been known to live within it.

Note, the language I used to make names for things pertaining to Þiuthangardi is the gothic language. I use both the Gothic alphabet and the romanization of Gothic to write these words. However, there are some modifications:

- To represent a voiced dental fricative (the ‘th’ in ‘father’, but not the ‘th’ of ‘thigh’ or ‘path’), I represent it in the Gothic alphabet with 𐌳𐌳, rather than 𐌳, to distinguish it from the voiced alveolar plosive (d).   
- A voiced dental fricative is ‘th’ rather than ‘d’.   
- While there are ‘environment-of-occurrence' and other rules to help distinguish this kinda stuff, I feel this is easier.  
- Note that the letter thorn (Þ and þ) is the ‘th’ in ‘thigh’ and ‘path’ (unvoiced dental fricative)

The Aleman Empire is an empire primarily consisting of the dragonborn (anthropomorphic dragons).

The current ruler is Ajahan Veterax. The whole royal family are innately Sources. Their magic tends to align along one facet of Chromatic magic. For instance, Kerian Veterax, the 3rd son of Ajahan Veterax, is aligned most to acid.

## Fathomsdeep

Fathomsdeep is the eastern region of the Aldwylds. The land considered part of Fathomsdeep are beaches and coves. However, Fathomsdeep also extends into the sea, especially for aquatic species and those with access to the latest diving technology.

It is possibly the wealthiest region, being a port. Additionally, due to the sea, Quanta-holding crystals can be mined, and sea salt can be taken from the water.

Steam and magic-powered equipment is more likely to be found in Fathomsdeep.
