# Okay!

So, we're going to fuse sci-fi and magic.

- Probably not going to go too hard into the Sci.
- As much as I like all that technobabble with stuff like nanotech and such
- B-but... phased arrays..

Hmm, well, a lot of sci-fi's problems (how stuuuuuuupidly huge and empty space is) can be solved by magic? Teleportation! Space distortion to make reactionless drives!

I don't really want to make Spelljammer 2.0...

But we might be making Warhammer 40,000 2.0, we'll see. Well, wasn't that just the original (fantasy) game blended with Dune? 

So we mixed up DOOM with Dune—I might be able to to use that

Lots of talk of mushrooms—use it as a spice / melange analogue? Reminds me of this indie horror game about dog mushing and getting taken over by the forest.

to take stock and recap
I/we're making a blend of SCI-FI and MAGIC
we want it to be GRIMDARK because we love TRAUMA
we want PSYCHOACTIVE MUSHROOMS because we love DRUGS
we mix up DOOM and DUNE on a regular basis
