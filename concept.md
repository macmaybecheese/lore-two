# Okay!

So, we're going to fuse sci-fi and magic.

- Probably not going to go too hard into the Sci.
- As much as I like all that technobabble with stuff like nanotech and such
- B-but... phased arrays..

Hmm, well, a lot of sci-fi's problems (how stuuuuuuupidly huge and empty space is) can be solved by magic? Teleportation! Space distortion to make reactionless drives!

I don't really want to make Spelljammer 2.0...
